\section{Conclusion}

After establishing a casual relationship between SST and chlorophyll concentration using regression analysis. We then found published literature that justified the relationship using physical and biological systems that are known about the ocean and phytoplankton. We then extended this relationship into two well-documented MHWs, the 2012 North West Atlantic and 2003 Mediterranean Sea MHW, which back up the casual relationship. To improve upon our relationship, we could further our research into other variables that MHWs alter, other than SST. Such as ocean currents and investigate the impact that these other variables have on phytoplankton and mechanism they rely on. A deeper look into the exchange of nutrients between ocean layers would also deepen our understanding as we only considered it simple when in fact it is a very complex system which relies on many variables such as distance to the equator, the hemisphere you are on and atmospheric conditions, it could prove important to find which factor between location and temperature have the biggest impact on the health of phytoplankton.
